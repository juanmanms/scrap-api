# My JS App

## Overview
My JS App is a JavaScript application that processes incoming URL parameters for `page$$.eval` and `elements`. It serves as a foundation for building more complex applications that require dynamic data handling based on URL inputs.

## Project Structure
```
my-js-app
├── src
│   ├── index.mjs        # Main entry point of the application
│   └── utils
│       └── helpers.mjs  # Utility functions for processing
├── package.json         # npm configuration file
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Installation
To get started with My JS App, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd my-js-app
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
node src/index.mjs
```

You can pass URL parameters for `page$$.eval` and `elements` to see how the application processes them.
